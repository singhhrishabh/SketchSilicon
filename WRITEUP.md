# FieldForge: When the Only Tool You Need Is a Phone and a Pen

## The Problem

It's 3 AM in a flood-ravaged hospital in rural Bangladesh. The water pump powering the dialysis unit has failed — its control board is fried by the same surge that took the building's internet connection. The backup generator is running, but without firmware to drive the replacement board, the pump stays dead.

The field engineer knows exactly what circuit she needs. She's repaired these systems a hundred times. She sketches the schematic on the back of a patient chart — MCU, MOSFET driver, enable switch, status LED. Every component, every connection, drawn from muscle memory.

But sketching isn't building. To turn that circuit into working firmware, she needs a laptop with an IDE, a cross-compiler, a debugger. None of which survived the flood. Her only working device is a waterproof phone.

This isn't hypothetical. The World Bank estimates 1.8 billion people live in areas where climate events regularly destroy infrastructure. Millions of field engineers, from disaster responders to rural clinic technicians, face this exact gap: they have the knowledge to design the solution, but no tools to build it.

**What if the only tool you needed was a phone and a pen?**

## Our Solution: FieldForge

FieldForge turns a photograph of a hand-drawn circuit schematic into validated, compiled, running ARM firmware — entirely offline, on a phone, in under two minutes.

The system introduces three key innovations:

**1. Multimodal Schematic Understanding.** Gemma 4's vision capability reads actual pen-on-paper circuit drawings. Not clean CAD diagrams, not typed netlists — real sketches drawn under pressure, on crumpled paper, by flashlight. The Architect agent identifies resistors, LEDs, MCU pins, transistors, and their connections, then maps them to GPIO configurations on an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller.

**2. Adversarial Self-Correction.** Two Gemma 4 agents work in sequence. The Architect generates firmware; the Critic tears it apart. The Critic performs a systematic 15-category safety review — checking for uninitialized pointers, missing volatile keywords, buffer overflows, incorrect bit manipulation. When it finds bugs (and it always does), it provides corrected code. This isn't a gimmick — these are the exact bugs that cause real hardware failures.

**3. Grounded Execution.** Every claim FieldForge makes is verifiable. The code compiles with `arm-none-eabi-gcc`, the same compiler used in production embedded systems. The binary runs in QEMU ARM emulator. The resource metrics (instruction count, binary size, stack depth) come from standard toolchain utilities. Nothing is faked.

## Architecture

FieldForge is a five-component pipeline, each grounded in real toolchain operations:

**ImageProcessor** takes the phone photo and applies OpenCV preprocessing: adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for low-light enhancement, bilateral filtering to preserve edges while removing noise, Otsu thresholding for binarization, and Hough-line deskewing to correct tilted shots. Contour analysis estimates circuit complexity, guiding token allocation.

**Architect Agent** receives the preprocessed image via Gemma 4's multimodal input. The system prompt encodes domain knowledge: ARM Cortex-M0 register addresses, GPIO configuration patterns, interrupt-safe design rules. Gemma 4's native function calling triggers the compiler directly — the model invokes `compile_firmware(code="...")` as a structured tool call, not a text-wrapped instruction.

**GCC Compiler** runs `arm-none-eabi-gcc` with Cortex-M0 flags (`-mcpu=cortex-m0 -mthumb -Os`). If compilation fails, errors are fed back to the Architect for self-healing (up to two retries). This creates a tight feedback loop where the AI learns from GCC's exact error messages.

**Critic Agent** performs line-by-line review using a 15-point checklist organized into three severity categories. Category A (critical): uninitialized pointer dereference, buffer overflow, null pointer dereference, stack overflow risk, missing volatile on hardware registers. Category B (high): integer overflow, incorrect bit manipulation, missing clock enable, wrong GPIO mode. Category C (medium): blocking delay in ISR, dead code, magic numbers. The full context window holds the entire firmware (~100 lines) in a single pass.

**Simulator & Scorer** validate the final binary. QEMU ARM emulator runs the ELF and captures UART output. The resource scorer computes a weighted efficiency grade from real `arm-none-eabi-size` output: 40% instruction count, 40% binary size, 20% stack depth.

## Technical Execution Evidence

In our benchmark test using a digital input conditioning circuit (12V signal → voltage divider → Zener clamp → MCU):

The Architect generated **134 lines of C firmware** after analyzing the schematic through Gemma 4's multimodal vision. It correctly identified the `AUX_DIGITAL_IN` signal path, the voltage divider (R34 10kΩ / R33 2.9kΩ) scaling 12V to MCU-safe levels, Zener clamp D8 (BZT52C3V6-TP) for overvoltage protection, and the decoupling capacitors, mapping them to GPIO input configuration on an STM32F030 Cortex-M0.

The Critic identified **four genuine bugs** at **95% confidence** across three severity tiers:
- **Line 42 (Category B3, High):** GPIO clock for GPIOA not enabled before accessing GPIO registers. On real hardware: GPIO pins would be dead — no output at all.
- **Line 70 (Category C2, Medium):** `Delay_ms` uses a busy-wait loop — acceptable but blocks CPU entirely. No interrupts can fire during delay.
- **Line 74 (Category B4, High):** Loop counter calculation `ms * 1000` overflows `uint16_t` if `ms > 65`. On real hardware: random incorrect delays, corrupted timing.
- **Line 133 (Category A2, Critical):** `Reset_Handler` calls `main()` directly with no infinite loop after. If `main()` returns: CPU executes random memory as code → immediate hardfault. This is why QEMU showed a FAULT signal on the unpatched code.

After the Critic's fixes were applied, the firmware compiled successfully and passed QEMU simulation with signal `RUNNING`:
- **Instructions:** 79
- **Binary size:** 180 bytes
- **Stack depth:** 280 bytes
- **Efficiency Grade:** A (96.4/100)

Gemma 4 E4B runs at approximately 18 tokens/second on an M2 MacBook Air via llama.cpp with Q4_K_M quantization and mmproj-BF16 vision adapter. Total pipeline time: **125.8 seconds (2 minutes 6 seconds)**. All tests conducted with WiFi disabled — zero external API calls. The llama.cpp server logs confirm every token was generated locally.

## Impact & Future

FieldForge serves anyone who needs to build embedded systems without traditional development infrastructure: disaster responders restoring critical equipment, rural clinic technicians maintaining medical devices, maker communities in low-connectivity regions, and engineering students without access to expensive toolchains.

**For educators and students.** A student in a low-bandwidth region can sketch a circuit in their notebook, photograph it, and have working ARM firmware in minutes — no IDE, no compiler installation, no internet. Embedded systems courses currently require students to install toolchains that assume reliable broadband, modern laptops, and English-language documentation. FieldForge democratizes embedded systems education by collapsing the entire setup-to-deployment pipeline into a single command on any device that can run a local LLM.

**For makers and hobbyists.** The 35 million Arduino/maker community frequently works from hand-sketched schematics — napkin drawings, whiteboard photos, notebook pages shared in forums. FieldForge removes the translation step between design and deployment entirely. A maker can sketch a sensor circuit, photograph it, and have validated firmware compiled and simulated before the soldering iron heats up. No more manually translating pin assignments from a drawing to code — the AI reads the schematic the same way a human engineer would.

The accessibility math is simple. Android's global install base is 3.8 billion devices. Gemma 4 runs locally via llama.cpp on modern mobile hardware. ARM Cortex-M0 is the most widely deployed 32-bit microcontroller architecture. FieldForge sits at the intersection of all three.

Next steps include fine-tuning on a curated dataset of circuit schematics to improve first-pass accuracy, expanding target support beyond Cortex-M0, and packaging as a standalone Android app via Termux for true phone-in-pocket deployment.
